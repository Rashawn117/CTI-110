# Write a program that gives simple math quizzes.

'''
Make the program a menu driven program. Meaning the program is to display a list of options to the user to choose from. List of options is shown below
 Add another function to the program that subtracts the generated random numbers. When program is executed, the MENU is to be displayed and user enters their choice. If user enters "1", the program is to add the numbers and asks user to guess what they add to. If "2" is entered, the program displays the numbers but asks enter the remainder of the subtraction and REMEMBER, program only terminates if user enters 3
    When/if user enters 1, the program is to execute a function that generates the numbers, adds them, asks user for enter an answer and display results.
    When/if user enters 2, the program is to execute a function that generates the numbers, subtracts them, asks user for enter an answer and display results.
    If/when the user enters 3, the program is to terminate.
    If/when user enters anything other than 1, 2, or 3, an error message should display letting the user know, then the menu should display again.
    When/if user guesses the right number, congratulate them and display the menu again to give them the option to play again
Program only terminates if user enters 3
