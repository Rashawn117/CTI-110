# Ask user to enter for number of scores they would like to enter. 
# Create a loop to collect the number of scores the user wants to enter.
# Note every time a score is entered, the following should be done
# Evaluate if the score is valid, it should be between 0 and 100 . 
# If it is not, notify the user and ask for a VALID score to be entered.
# Think of using another loop
# If score is valid, add the score to a list. Make sure the score list is given an informative name.
# After collecting all the scores. The program is to display the following:
# Lowest score entered
# Score List after dropping lowest score
# The average of scores in modified list
# Determine the letter grade for the calculated average and display it to user.
